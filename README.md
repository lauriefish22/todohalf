-   Users should be able to "complete" items on their to do list (UPDATE)
-   Users should be able to delete all of their todos (DELETE)

## Rubric

The following is required for your assignment to be graded:

-   PR open from `dev` to `main`
-   PR Passes CI (lint + tests)
-   PR preview on netlify
-   At least 4 commits, for each working feature

DATA MODEL

shopping list items
id
created_at
item
quantity
is_bought
user_id

AUTH PAGE

come with template

LIST PAGE- slices

1. on submit: user should be able to add an item and it's quantity.
   get form data in a submit listener. Remember (e) etc..
   submit
   <input name="quantity" />
   const data = new formData(myFormEl);
   `data.get('quantity')`
   using form data, we send it to SB to create a new list_item.

2. on submit: user can see the items added. but only their own items.
   -fetch the users list items
   -put them in state
   -clear the DOM out and re-display the list_items

3. on click: user should be able to designate the item as "bought" but only their own items.
   -after we render each item, call sB

4. on load: fetch, render and append the items the user already added in the past. but only their own items.
   -fetch the users list items
   -put them in state
   -clear the DOM out and re-display the list_items

5. when rendering the list, items that are "bought" should be rendered differently.but only their own items.
   -in our renderListItem function
   look at the boolean is_bought
   if is_bought is true, put a new class on the element

on load: if user is logged in, display the email in header.
